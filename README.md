## Live Coding Exercise [30m]

Let's use this (somewhat familiar) problem as a demo example:

> Write a node program that takes in an unlimited number of command line arguments, goes through each and prints out the sum of them.

1. Pseudocode [10m]
2. Incremental Implementation [20m]

Error Driven Development
 - Cause errors first and use them to your adv
 - 

## ~Visualizing Code [10m]~

## Recap & Takeaways [5m]

- Plan your solution using Pseudocode so that you're not worrying about syntax
- Error Driven Development (work incrementally using errors to your advantage)
- At each incremental step, Use scientific method (hypothesis then affirmation) before running your code
- The queue is not just for when you'er stuck (before, during, after)
- Mentor-based approach to teaching
  - Up to you to bridge the differences that you may get from diff mentors
  - Context about what got you here ("KV helped me by saying I should X, I did X, now I need help going towards Y") 
  - "What have you done so far to troubleshoot?"
- For..of loop instead of using C-style for (counting) loop
- Git workflow for a repo that we created from scratch (no cloning)
- Great cohort with a lot of good discourse and questions etc!
- Approach is key!
  - Debugging being the key skill to focus on developing during this program
